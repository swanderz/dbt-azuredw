# dbt-azuredw

dbt-azuredw is a custom adapter for [dbt](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt) that adds support for Azure SQL Data Warehouse.. pyodbc is used as the connection driver as that is what is [suggested by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/python/python-driver-for-sql-server). The adapter supports both windows auth, and specified user accounts.

dbt-azuredw is currently in a beta release.

## Connecting to Azure SQL Data Warehouse

## building your `profiles.yml`
Use the profiles.yml file included as a guide, updating with your creds. You can find all the creds you need under _Home > dbname (account/dbname) - Connection strings_ in Azure, along with the username and password for authentication. 

## Getting Started
1. Run this to keep your profiles.yml from tracking:

``` 
git update-index --skip-worktree profiles.yml
```

2. Update profiles.yml with your actual Azure Data Warehouse creds.
3. Build the docker image. From the repo root:

```
docker build . -t dbt-azure-dw
```

4. Run a bash shell in the container:

```
docker run -v $(PWD):/dbt_development/plugins -it dbt-azure-dw /bin/bash
```

you can then jump into `jaffle_shop (mssql)` and work on making it run against your ADW!  


**Sample profiles.yml**

```yaml

default:	
  target: dev	
  outputs:	
    dev:	
      type: azuredw	
      driver: 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server'	
      host: account.database.windows.net	
      database: dbt_test	
      schema: foo	
      username: dbt_user	
      password: super_secret_dbt_password
      authentication: ActiveDirectoryPassword   
```

## Known Issues
- At this time dbt-azuredw supports only `table`, `view` and `incremental` materializations (no `ephemeral`)
- Only top-level (model) CTEs are supported, ie CTEs in macros are not supported (this is a sqlserver thing)



## Jaffle Shop

Fishtown Analytic's [jaffle shop](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/jaffle_shop) package is currently unsupported by this adapter. At the time of this writing, jaffle shop uses the `using()` join, and `group by [ordinal]` notation which is not supported in T-SQL. An alternative version has been forked by the author of dbt-mssql [here](https://github.com/jacobm001/jaffle_shop_mssql).
